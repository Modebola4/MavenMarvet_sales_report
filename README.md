This repository is a case study, Analysis and visualization of MavenMarket Sales using Power query and Power BI.
This report was made based on MavenMarket Sales (1997-1998) in three countries.
-The dateset was gotten from Maven Analytics. 
-I imported the Datasets with the use of Power Query editor into Power BI, then I cleaned and transformed the Data. 
-I formed a relationship with my data in the Modeling view.
